# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing SignupComponent to create a complete authentication system with improved user experience, proper API integration, and authentication state management. The system will provide both login and registration functionality with form validation, error handling, and persistent authentication state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with clear form labels and validation feedback, so that I can easily create an account without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the signup form THEN the system SHALL display clearly labeled input fields with floating labels or proper placeholders
2. WHEN a user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL display specific validation messages for each field
3. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/api/auth/register` endpoint
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token and redirect the user to the dashboard
5. IF registration fails THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message returned from the API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to log into my account with a clean interface, so that I can access my dashboard quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Login" link THEN the system SHALL switch to the login form view
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token and redirect to the dashboard
4. IF login fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message without clearing the form
5. WHEN a user views the login form THEN the system SHALL display password requirements as helper text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my authentication state across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token securely in localStorage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication token and maintain logged-in state
3. WHEN a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the login page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the stored token and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to use environment variables for API configuration, so that the application can work across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes API calls THEN the system SHALL use the base URL from environment variables
2. WHEN no environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default localhost URL
3. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use axios for consistent request handling
4. WHEN authenticated requests are made THEN the system SHALL include the JWT token in the Authorization header

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate visual feedback when interacting with forms, so that I understand the current state of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a form THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the submit button
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight invalid fields with red borders
3. WHEN API requests are in progress THEN the system SHALL disable form inputs to prevent duplicate submissions
4. WHEN switching between login and register views THEN the system SHALL clear any existing error messages
5. WHEN forms are successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL show a brief success indication before redirecting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation that guides me to create secure passwords, so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the password field THEN the system SHALL validate password strength in real-time
2. WHEN password requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL display specific missing requirements
3. WHEN a password meets all requirements THEN the system SHALL show a green checkmark or success indicator
4. WHEN a user submits a form with invalid password THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the issues
5. IF the API returns password validation errors THEN the system SHALL display the server-side validation messages
